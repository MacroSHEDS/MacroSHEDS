\title{Download MacroSheds watershed attributes}
\usage{
ms_download_ws_attr(
  macrosheds_root,
  dataset = "summaries",
  quiet = FALSE,
  version = "1.0",
  omit_climate_data = FALSE,
  timeout = 10000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{macrosheds_root}{character. Directory where watershed attribute files will be downloaded.
If this directory does not exist, it will be created. Does not have to be the same
as \code{macrosheds_root} provided to \code{\link[=ms_download_core_data]{ms_download_core_data()}}, but might as well be.}

\item{dataset}{character. This function can download each of the four collections of watershed attribute data
provided by MacroSheds. "summaries" will download a feather file containing watershed attributes
summarized across time and space (i.e. one value for each site). "time series" will download 6 feather
files containing time series of watershed attributes where available. See \code{omit_climate_data} parameter.
"CAMELS summaries" and "CAMELS Daymet forcings" will download additional watershed
summary data that conform as closely as possible to the specifications of the
\href{https://ral.ucar.edu/solutions/products/camels}{CAMELS dataset}. See MacroSheds metadata
for a list of discrepancies. Once downloaded, data can be loaded into R with \code{\link[=ms_load_product]{ms_load_product()}}.}

\item{quiet}{logical. If TRUE, some messages will be suppressed.}

\item{version}{character. The MacroSheds dataset version to download, e.g. "1.0". Defaults to
most recent. As of 2023-03-17, only version 1.0 is available, so this parameter is a stub.}

\item{omit_climate_data}{logical. Ignored unless \code{dataset == 'time series'}. If you don't care about climate data,
you may use this argument to avoid downloading it (because it's huge), while still downloading
terrain, vegetation, parent material, land use, and hydrology data (which are tiny).}

\item{timeout}{integer. Temporarily overrides getOption(timeout).}
}
\value{
Returns NULL. Downloads watershed attribute data to the
directory specified by \code{macrosheds_root}. For documentation, visit

}
\description{
Download MacroSheds watershed attribute data for all sites. Choose between
temporally explicit spatial summaries, or summaries across both time and space.
