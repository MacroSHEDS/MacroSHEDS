\title{Drop MacroSheds variable prefixes}
\usage{
ms_drop_var_prefix(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{character MacroSheds variable code with a prefix.}
}
\value{
Returns a vector of MacroSheds variable codes without their two character prefixes.
If prefixes are missing, returns \code{x} with an warning.
}
\description{
Remove the two-letter prefixes from MacroSheds variable codes. See details.
}
\details{
MacroSheds variable codes all include a two-letter prefix to denote the
sampling regimen. The first letter is either I for "installed"
or G for "grab," denoting if this variable was recorded by a continuously
monitoring piece of equipment, or manually by a human.
The second position is either S for "sensor" or N for "non-sensor".
Non-sensor samples are generally measured analytically, in a laboratory.
For more information, see PLACEHOLDER0.
